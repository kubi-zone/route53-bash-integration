# kubizone-route53-bash

This is an example integration between Kubizone and Route53.

It is written in bash, using the `aws` and `kubectl` commands to show
a very simplified way of quickly building (fragile) integrations between
the Kubizone ecosystem of zones and records, and real-life production-grade
DNS systems.

This is *not* intended for use in production environments, it is merely
written to demonstrate one very hacky way of building an integration.
